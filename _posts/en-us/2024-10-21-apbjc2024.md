I attended the APBJC2024 conference in Naha, Japan. It's my second conference. So excited!

        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/20221028_fuji.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

    We see mount Fuji almost everyday, if weather is good

It was much easier to get there because I live in Japan. There were lots of nice presentations.

I had a chance to talk to some bioinformaticians from Australia and Europe. Their research is interesting
