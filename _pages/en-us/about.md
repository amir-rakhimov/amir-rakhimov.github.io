I am a PhD student from Kazakhstan at the National Institute of Genetics, Japan. I am in the Biological networks laboratory under supervision of Masanori Arita. We collaborate with Kyoko Miura's lab at Kumamoto University.

My research focuses on naked mole-ratâ€™s and their longevity. I analyse gut microbiome data.
