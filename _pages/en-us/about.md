I am a PhD student from Kazakhstan at the National Institute of Genetics, Japan. In 2022, I joined Biological Networks laboratory led by Masanori Arita. 

I am studying genomics of various animals.

In the future, I want to work on a genomics project, specifically related to transposable elements. Recent studies show that transposable elements are important drivers of evolution. The repertoire of transposable element sequences differs between organisms even among members of the same order. With more genomes being sequenced, it is important to understand the contribution of transposable elements to evolution and ecological niche adaptation.
